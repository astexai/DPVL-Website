      <p>The Delhi Pro Volleyball League (DPVL) marks a historic moment for the capital — the arrival of Delhi's first-ever professional volleyball league designed to transform how the sport is played, watched, and celebrated across Delhi & NCR.</p>

      <p><strong>"Where Delhi Rises. Where Champions Play."</strong> is more than a tagline. It's a statement of intent to build a competitive, culturally rooted, and professionally managed volleyball ecosystem for athletes, fans, and communities.</p>

      <h2>Why DPVL Matters for Delhi</h2>
      <p>Delhi has always been a powerhouse of sporting culture. From school grounds to college courts and local tournaments, volleyball has lived in the city's grassroots for decades. What it lacked was a structured, professional platform. DPVL fills this gap with:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>8 city-based franchise teams</li>
        <li>29 high-intensity matches across 15 days</li>
        <li>A league format built on fairness, rivalry, and storytelling</li>
        <li>A fan experience designed like a sporting festival</li>
      </ul>

      <p>DPVL is not just a tournament. It is the foundation of a sustainable volleyball movement for the capital.</p>

      <h2>Built on Three Cultural Values</h2>

      <h3>Inspiration</h3>
      <p>Young athletes finally see a professional pathway within their own city.</p>

      <h3>Representation</h3>
      <p>Each region of Delhi is represented by a franchise that reflects its identity, pride, and sporting spirit.</p>

      <h3>Celebration</h3>
      <p>DPVL combines sport, entertainment, music, and community energy to create an unforgettable arena experience.</p>

      <h2>The 6 Franchises That Represent Delhi</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Eastern Eagles</strong> — The Pride of East Delhi</li>
        <li><strong>Western Warriors</strong> — Built for Battle</li>
        <li><strong>Purani Dilli Panthers</strong> — Old Delhi's Untamed Spirit</li>
        <li><strong>New Delhi Titans</strong> — Modern, Powerful, Unstoppable</li>
        <li><strong>Northern Ninjas</strong> — Fast. Focused. Fearless.</li>
        <li><strong>Southern Spikers</strong> — South Delhi's Dominators</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each team is designed to be a cultural badge for its region, allowing fans to connect emotionally with their side of the city.</p>

      <h2>Leadership Rooted in Sport and Professionalism</h2>
      <p>DPVL is founded by leaders who understand volleyball both as athletes and as professionals.</p>

      <h3>Neeti Rawat — Director & Co-Founder</h3>
      <p>A renowned sports presenter and former volleyball athlete, bringing credibility, insight, and authentic storytelling to the league.</p>

      <h3>Jasoda Gulliya — Director & Co-Founder</h3>
      <p>A national-level volleyball athlete and corporate leader, blending sports discipline with strategic execution.</p>

      <p>Their leadership ensures DPVL is built for athletes, by athletes.</p>

      <h2>More Than Matches — A 15-Day Sporting Festival</h2>
      <p>DPVL aims to create an arena environment where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Families come for entertainment and sport together</li>
        <li>Youth find role models from their own neighborhoods</li>
        <li>Fans engage through stories, highlights, and community pride</li>
        <li>Volleyball becomes a mainstream spectator experience in Delhi</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Mission</h3>
      <p>To establish a competitive, sustainable, and community-driven volleyball ecosystem that nurtures talent, enhances sports culture, and delivers world-class entertainment.</p>

      <h3>Vision</h3>
      <p>To make Delhi the epicenter of India's volleyball revolution and set national benchmarks in professionalism, fan experience, talent development, and sports storytelling.</p>

      <h2>The Beginning of a New Era</h2>
      <p>The Delhi Pro Volleyball League 2025 is not a one-time spectacle. It is the start of a long-term movement to elevate volleyball into a major sport in the capital.</p>

      <p>For players, it is a dream platform.<br/>
      For fans, it is a new passion.<br/>
      For Delhi, it is a matter of pride.</p>

      <p>The Delhi Pro Volleyball League (DPVL) is officially set to debut in 2026, introducing a franchise-based professional structure for volleyball in the national capital. Designed to identify, nurture, and promote serious talent, DPVL aims to create a clear, merit-based pathway for players to rise from grassroots to a professional platform.</p>

      <p>This is not just a tournament announcement — it's the beginning of a structured volleyball ecosystem for Delhi and a significant boost to India's growing volleyball movement.</p>

      <h2>Institutional Strength Behind the League</h2>
      <p>DPVL has been launched with strong governance and sports administration support from:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Delhi Volleyball Association</li>
        <li>Delhi Olympic Association</li>
        <li>Guidance aligned with the Volleyball Federation of India</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The announcement was led by former Indian volleyball players:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neeti Rawat</li>
        <li>Jasoda Gulliya</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Their involvement ensures that player realities, development gaps, and performance needs are built into the league's structure from day one.</p>

      <p>Kuldeep Vats, President of the Delhi Olympic Association and Joint Secretary of VFI, reaffirmed full organisational backing — signalling long-term seriousness, not a short-term event.</p>

      <h2>League Format — 6 Franchises, Professional Setup</h2>
      <p>DPVL will feature:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Six franchise teams</li>
        <li>Professional match environment</li>
        <li>Organised schedule and competitive structure</li>
        <li>Branding, visibility, and fan engagement similar to top pro leagues</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Each franchise will represent competitive identity while giving athletes exposure to professional team culture, coaching systems, and match pressure.</p>

      <h2>Transparent Open Trials — Performance Over Connections</h2>
      <p>A standout feature of DPVL is its open and transparent trial system.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Trials open for Delhi players and talent across India</li>
        <li>Selection purely on skill, fitness, and performance</li>
        <li>No closed-door selections</li>
        <li>Equal opportunity platform for emerging athletes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This approach directly addresses one of Indian volleyball's biggest challenges — limited visibility for deserving players.</p>

      <h2>Building a Sustainable Volleyball Ecosystem in Delhi</h2>
      <p>According to Sudhir Vats, President of the Delhi Volleyball Association, DPVL is designed to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identify regional talent early</li>
        <li>Retain Delhi's best players within a competitive structure</li>
        <li>Strengthen the state's volleyball infrastructure</li>
        <li>Provide continuity from junior level to professional exposure</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Co-founder Jasoda Gulliya emphasized that DPVL is not just a league, but a long-term framework connecting:</p>
      <p><strong>Players → Coaches → Teams → Sponsors → Fans → Administration</strong></p>

      <h2>Recognition of Young Talent at Launch</h2>
      <p>During the launch ceremony, Delhi's Junior Boys and Girls volleyball teams were felicitated for their national-level performances.</p>

      <p>This recognition highlighted two things:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Delhi already has deep volleyball talent</li>
        <li>DPVL is the next step to elevate these athletes onto a professional stage</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Strategic Timing for Indian Volleyball Growth</h2>
      <p>Indian volleyball has seen rising interest and professionalism with leagues like the Prime Volleyball League (PVL).</p>

      <p>DPVL complements this growth by adding a strong state-level professional base. It creates a feeder system where players can gain exposure, experience, and recognition before reaching national and international levels.</p>

      <h2>What DPVL Means for Different Stakeholders</h2>
